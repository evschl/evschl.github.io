                        This page will be about an ongoing, on-and-off project I've dedicated myself to completing. 
                        Well, not exactly, since I haven't kept up with it for a good half a year, but if I were to have any amount of desire to play the Pok&eacute;mon series, I would continue in this long, arduous journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if you've never touched a piece of Pok&eacute;mon media in your life, it is still the largest video game franchise in the world, so it's unavoidable that you at least know of its existence. 
                        I'm sure you've at least heard the phrase “Gotta Catch 'Em All!” stapled to every piece of marketing material ever produced for the series. 
                        As ubiquitous as that phrase is in the context of Pok&eacute;mon, actually <em>CATCHING</em> them all is quite a difficult task that very few people ever actually accomplish (<em>without the use of cheating devices</em>). 
                        This is especially difficult considering that each game is <strong>cumulative</strong>. 
                        This means that for, say, the 5<sup>th</sup> game in the series, you would have to catch <strong>all</strong> of the Pok&eacute;mon introduced in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, AND 5<sup>th</sup> games. 
                        Still using the 5<sup>th</sup> game example, this means that you would have to catch a grand total of <strong>649 Pok&eacute;mon</strong>, each with their own individual requirements.
                    </p>

                        Really, this was an excuse to play the game on the right, which I had owned for a while. 
                        This is the 3rd wave of games released, referred to as “Generation 3”. 
                        Luckily, unlike the later games, you can get all of the Pok&eacute;mon in this generation without having to transfer from previous games. 
                        To complete this task, I'll need to catch <strong>386 Pok&eacute;mon</strong>.

                        I play through Emerald in about a day, as I've played it a couple times before, and take my time with FireRed. 
                        It takes me a couple weeks for FireRed, as I want to take my time with it on my first playthrough and enjoy it as an experience outside of my challenge.
                        I catch probably around 20 in each game before finishing their stories and having all of the areas opened up to me.
                        Most Pok&eacute;mon are caught by entering tiles that have a chance of giving you an encounter.
                        Each area has a distinct table of Pok&eacute;mon you can encounter on these tiles.
                        As a result, most of the catches involve simply moving into an area, collecting everything, and then leaving to another.
                        However... the keyword here is <strong>most</strong>.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        By the time I've caught all the Pok&eacute;mon that can simply be caught by random tile encounters, I've caught about 2/3 of the available Pok&eacute;mon. 
                        Now, I get into the annoying catches..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Feebas, a fish Pok&eacute;mon, he can only be caught on 5 water tiles out of around 450 in an area.
                        These tiles are visibly no different than any other water tiles, and move every day.
                        Even if you attempt to encounter it on one of the five correct tiles, you have a 50% chance of encountering a different Pok&eacute;mon.
                        This means you could potentially <strong>pass over</strong> one of the five tiles if you get unlucky, and attempting multiple encounters on the same tile before moving on is almost required.
                        This process is <strong>notorious</strong> for taking an excruciatingly long time, and could take multiple days.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/waves.png">
                    <p>
                        However, I get extremely, <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> lucky.
                        Most guides suggest you attempt 3 encounters on each tile before you move on, meaning there is a 1/8 chance you move on from a Feebas-populated tile.
                        I feel that 3 isn't enough for me to feel safe in moving on, and decide to make it 5, bringing the probability down to 1/32.
                        I start my encounters fully expecting this to take multiple hours.
                        After the first tile I move on to the second.
                        After the fourth encounter on the second tile, I'm sure there isn't a Feebas, but I'm committed to the process.
                        On the fifth encounter on the second tile, <strong>THERE IT IS!</strong>
                        The odds of this are so low, about 1 in 2500!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm sure I used all my positive luck catching Feebas, because the next was much more difficult than it should have been.
                        Its name is Psyduck, and has a 1% encounter rate. 
                        1% is low already, but especially in the context of Pok&eacute;mon.
                        You spend about 15 seconds between encounters, so a 1% encounter rate should take around ~50 minutes to get two.
                        My perception of time may have been warped, but I swear I was there for at least 5 hours.
                        I got up, ate, did some errands, and got back to it before finishing it up.

                        Now that I've finished catching all the Pok&eacute;mon I could, now comes the time to "evolve" some of them.
                        An evolved Pok&eacute;mon turns into a completely different Pok&eacute;mon, and we'll need both to "Catch 'Em All!".
                        I needed two Psyduck in the previous example because it evolves once, meaning to have all Pok&eacute;mon I'd need to have it and its evolution.
                        Most Pok&eacute;mon evolve through leveling up, although there are some general exceptions.
                        Most alternate evolutions involve a single-use item, getting their "friendship" level high enough, or trading them away to another game.
                        The single-use items are not hard to come by, so this was not very difficult.
                        Getting high friendship level Pok&eacute;mon to evolve didn't take long, as artificially raising their levels is easy with items.
                        Trading does not take very long either.
                        The real trouble came from level evolutions, which is the vast majority of them.
                        There is an item to shortcut this process that raises a Pok&eacute;mon's level by 1, but the benchmark is typically around 30-40 for a fully-evolved Pok&eacute;mon.
                        These items are not purchasable through in-game currency on nearly the scale that is required for me, so I resort to some glitches.
                        If I didn't, this entire project would easily have taken 4 times the total amount of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's a way to save your game in a way that updates your personal inventory, but fails to update the Pok&eacute;mon you have stored.
                        I can abuse this by giving a Pok&eacute;mon the level-raising item and properly saving, then taking the item and glitch-saving.
                        When I reload, the Pok&eacute;mon will still have the item even though I took it from them before glitch-saving.
                        If I give another Pok&eacute;mon the ones I have in my inventory and properly save, then repeat the glitch-saving process, I can double the number of
                        I can repeat this as many times as I want to double them each time, quickly making it to the number I need.
                        After evolving all the Pok&eacute;mon through leveled evolution, I now have every single Pok&eacute;mon I can possibly get <strong>on one save file</strong> between the two games I have..

                        At the very beginning of every Pok&eacute;mon game, you get to choose between one of three "starters". 
                        As soon as you choose one of these Pok&eacute;mon, you are immediately barred from getting any other of the starters unless you trade with another game.
                        FireRed and LeafGreen have completely different starters, which means that to get all of the starters, you will have to play through each game a minimum of 3 times.
                        Additionally, you must first have all of the starters in Emerald to unlock an event to get one of the three of a third, completely separate set of starters.
                        This means that you must play through Emerald a minimum of 5 total times, trading 300+ Pok&eacute;mon each time.
                        The trading process is extremely tedious, taking ~15 seconds per trade.
                        With 8 times I had to completely transfer them all, this meant I spent roughly 10 total hours just trading.
                        Each reset save file meant I had to play through the entire game again, taking about 3 hours each time.
                        With 6 replays, I spent another 18 total hours just getting to the point where I was able to trade with the other game.
                        There were other Pok&eacute;mon that made you choose between it and another for each save file, but I knocked those out while resetting for the starters.

                        Unfortunately, each of the 5 games in this generation (except Emerald) have at least one Pok&eacute;mon that you can only get in that specific game.
                        This means that you would need to own 4/5 games in this generation to legitimately obtain all of them.

                        Looking at the left figure, this means that we have 18 Pok&eacute;mon left that we can't get between either game that I currently own.
                        Looking at the middle figure, we can see that Emerald has no Pok&eacute;mon that are exclusive to itself, requiring us to buy both other games to have access to them all.
                        Whereas, if you had Ruby or Sapphire, you would only have to buy the other game to have access to everything.
                        I knew about this going in, and had a summer job at the time, but I don't think I was ready for the actual price tag of these.
                        This was when COVID had first started, and the retro games market was absolutely exploding.
                        These games were released between 2002-2005, which meant that they were FAR out of print, and considered collector's items at this point.

                        Even though I had a summer job, I was NOT about to pay over $300 for legitimacy's sake.
                        I wasn't going to use an external device explicitly for cheating, but I knew of another glitch I could take advantage of to circumvent this.
                        The way I see it, as long as I use the tools given to me by the game, exploiting the game's systems is as legitimate as obtaining them by buying a new game.
                        Using cheating hardware is as easy as pressing a button and completing the entire challenge in minutes, but this glitch took way longer than just it would have finding them in the other 3 games.

                        To keep a long story short, the game stores all of your Pok&eacute;mon in two locations: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>Your Party, which has a max size of 6.</li>
                            <li>Your PC, which has a max size of 420.</li>
                        </ol>
                        You use different interfaces to interact with the party and the PC, but they are stored adjacent to each other in memory.
                        You cannot access your PC outside of a specific location, but through a method called <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Glitzer_Popping">"Glitzer Popping"</a>, you can access your PC from your party menu.
                        To do this, you will have to lower your party's base HP to zero without triggering a Game Over event, which can be achieved through the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pomeg_glitch">"Pomeg Glitch"</a>.
                        By traversing up through your party with a fainted team, instead of looping back on itself when you try to go up past the first like usual, the game will then move your selector into to the PC boxes from your party.
                        Because the program counter is not coded to handle this situation, some of the data about the Pok&eacute;mon in your PC gets swapped with the Pok&eacute;mon to them in the PC.
                        By placing specific Pok&eacute;mon next to each other in the PC with specific personal data, you can swap values to make one of them into an egg that hatches a completely different Pok&eacute;mon!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This way, you can hatch any Pok&eacute;mon from a glitched egg, making completing this challenge possible without purchasing all of the games in the generation!
                        Amazingly, we can do more with these eggs. 
                        Using <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">Arbitrary Code Execution</a>, we can create eggs that force the game move the program counter when hatched to trigger events otherwise impossible to trigger!
                        The technique of making eggs to hatch any Pok&eacute;mon was discovered in 2014, but when I was doing this, the technique of making eggs that trigger events had only been discovered a couple months prior!
                        The specific events I was interested in were warps to access content only available from Toys R' Us events as late as 2005.
                        These locations and events were hardcoded into the game on release, you only just needed to unlock it by going to these events in 2005.
                        Otherwise, it was impossible to access these locations without cheating devices.

                        I went on forums and watched the one or two videos that showed it actually working, and they were all on emulators.
                        At this point people were only talking about what it would be like to actually perform it on a physical copy.
                        I followed the tutorials to a tee, and it ACTUALLY WORKED!
                        I was, through no cheating devices, on an island that nobody had seen without a cheating device since 2005.
                        I mean, there had to be a couple other people like that had done this without posting anything anywhere, but it still felt like I was somewhere few people had ever been, and it felt amazing!
                        These were the last 4 Pok&eacute;mon I had to catch, and I saved the last Pok&eacute;mon by ID# for last, Deoxys.

                    Now that I have all Pok&eacute;mon from generation 3, if I wanted to collect all the Pok&eacute;mon the generation 4, I would just have to transfer everything from generation 3 and catch everything introduced in generation 4.
                    However, the same glitches I used in the previous series of games won't work on the next ones.
                    I can't duplicate items (<em>as far as I know</em>), and I can't access the event Pok&eacute;mon <strong>in the same way</strong>.
                    Just like in the last games these locations are hardcoded into the game, only waiting to be activated by an external device.
                    Through a method called "<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tweaking">Tweaking</a>", we can abuse the map loading system through race conditions to allow us to break free of the typical loading/unloading of the map.
                    If we move through load lines too quickly and in the correct order, we can confuse the game into loading areas we are not supposed to load.
                    Unlike Glitzer Popping, this method is apparently very unreliable and can corrupt your save file very easily.

                    As far as obtaining version-exclusive Pok&eacute;mon is concerned, my roommate (<em>he drew the Pok&eacute;mon on this and the 2nd page. Thank you Lucas!!</em>) has the complementary version to the one I already own, so I could just ask him to let me borrow his game for a bit.
                    All the dominoes are set up, it's just a matter of sitting down and committing myself to it.
                    I have too many other things occupying my time right now, but if I ever have the time to I would love to get right back to it!
