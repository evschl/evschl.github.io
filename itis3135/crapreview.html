	                <ul>
		                <li>The header bleeds into the main content of the page, with no clear separation using horizontal lines or colors/images.</li>
		                <li>The collection of images that make up the sidebar do not particularly contrast with the green or blue of the main contents of the page, and certainly do not make it easier to see the links in the sidebar.</li>
	                </ul>
                    <br>
	                <li class="principle">Repetition</li>
	                <ul>
		                <li>Granted, the color contrast between blue, green, and yellow is good design, but there is almost no rhyme or reason as to why they appear in different parts of the page. The header text is yellow, and so is the background for the informational images</li>
		                <li>Red is also used for a lot of the text, which is grating on the eyes.</li>
		                <li>The placement of clickable links and information is scattered, with no pattern to guide the eyes towards any sort of intentional organization.</li>
		                <li>The events listed at the bottom page use different font sizes to separate the difficulty level of the classes at some points, and asterisks to do the same thing at other points.</li>
		                <li>The font is not consistent between the main, header, and footer, and text within the informational images in main.</li>
		                <li>No use of horizontal lines, or anything that would clearly divide pieces of information</li>
		                <li>The formatting of the same information in the header and footer are different</li>
	                </ul>
                    <br>
	                <li class="principle">Alignment</li>
	                <ul>
		                <li>The text within the main element is all centered, leaving the webpage to look like a "christmas tree".</li>
		                <li>All elements float left, which makes it odd to look at when zooming out or in, as the right side of the page is vacant compared to the left</li>
	                </ul>
                    <br>
	                <li class="principle">Proximity</li>
	                <ul>
		                <li>Granted, the prices, dates, and times of events are always close together, but there is no consistent theme to how it is displayed.</li>
		                <li>There are multiple sections with clickable links, some being large buttons and some being text that is a link at the top or bottom of the page</li>
	                </ul>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>The background is a dark gray, while the elements containing relevant information are an almost-white shade of blue.</li>
                    <li>There is a consistent dark blue/white color palette to the page which is easy on the eyes.</li>
                </ul>

                <li class="principle">Repetition</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>All elements have a dark blue bar that spans the length of the main tag which describes the below information.</li>
                    <li>The text is a consistent shade of white, while the header and bars are always blue.</li>
                </ul>

                <li class="principle">Alignment</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The margins on the left and right scale properly with the zoom-in/out of the page.</li>
                    <li>On any page of the site, there are no more than two information boxes spanning the width of the site.</li>
                    <li>Except for the advertisement, margins and spacing are always conistent between elements.</li>
                </ul>

                <li class="principle">Proximity</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most relevant information, being recent listings and current exchange rates of items are at the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>Information gets more and more niche as you scroll down, moving from forum posts to recent price changes, to price change suggestions</li>
                    <li>Information about the name of an element is always on the left, while "view more" is always on the right.</li>
                    <li>For individual items, the name is always at the top, while the price is always at the bottom.</li>
