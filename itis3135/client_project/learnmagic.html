            <p>I'm by no means an expert, but I did work at a card shop for almost 2 years, so I've seen what hooks people about Magic&trade; and the process of building one's relationship with the game.</p>

            <h2 id="step1"><em>Color Identity Personality Quiz</em></h2>
            <p>
                Each color in magic has a core <span style="font-weight:bold;">identity</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">playstyle</span>, with unique mechanics and strategies.<br>
                You can play as many colors as you want in a deck in any combination, or even none! For the sake of learning, however, it is recommended that you choose the one that you think represents your style best!<br>
                <ul>White
                    <li>Themes: Honor, Order, Discipline.</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Attack with an army of smaller creatures.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Can be described as "honest", White strategies often revolve around outmaneuvering your opponents with superior battle tactics rather than casting flashy or fundamentally game-altering spells.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Blue
                    <li>Themes: Intelligence, Self-Improvement, Adaptibility</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Disrupt the opponent's strategy while accruing incremental advantage over the course of the game.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Significantly slower-paced than other colors, Blue strategies often make the game go longer and encourage proper threat assessment. Unique to blue is the ability to stop an opponent's spell while it's being cast, and can advance its game plan even on your opponent's turn.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Black
                    <li>Themes: Power, Sacrifice, Selfishness.</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Use your life total, other cards in your hand, other creatures, and your graveyard as a resource to summon powerful creatures.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Black is all about resource management, as it allows you trade your many resources for each other. Many of the game's more underhanded tactics come from black, but this is all intentional design.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Red
                    <li>Themes: Passion, Volatility, Aggression.</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Deal direct damage to the opponent before they can get set up.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Red players want the game to end in as few turns as possible. Red can put your opponent under sudden, unexpected pressure and kill them before they get the chance to start dealing with you.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Green
                    <li>Themes: Instinct, Tradition, Strength.</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Make mana faster than your opponents to produce harder-hitting, tougher threats than them.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Green often gives up its early game to set up for a mid-game where you're producing bigger, more hard-hitting creatures than your opponents that are hard to interact with and letting them speak for themselves.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 id="step2"><em>Your First Cards!</em></h2>
            <p>These next two steps will be much easier with a friend, preferably one that already knows the game, but there are plenty of resources at your disposal if you don't have one!</p>
            <p>If you have a friend with any amount of bulk cards, ask them if they would be willing to build small, single-colored decks out of their bulk.</p>
            <p>If you're the friend deciding to build some tutorial decks, cards from Core sets will be the most useful. You ideally want a majority of creatures, choosing cards with as few lines of text as possible, and no set mechanics if possible. New players will generally understand evergreen abilities, but only after they have been taught how creatures behave without the ability. For example, try not to put Vigilance on a creature that could potentially be the first creature that attacks in a game, as the new player won't have it ingrained that creatures tap to attack yet. Also, balancing isn't super important, as long as the new player gets the deck weighted to win. Early wins are possibly the most powerful tool in getting a new player on board, as they provide an <em>immense</em> sense of accomplishment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If your friend can't build you bulk decks, <em>DO NOT PLAY WITH THEIR 60+ CARD CONSTRUCTED DECKS</em>. While it may seem intuitive to learn with decks that are already lying around ready to play, having them teach you with any constructed deck will almost definitely leave you confused and discouraged.</p>
            <p>Instead, your local game store will have <em>FREE</em> 30-card single-color decks made specifically for teaching new players. If you don't have a friend, there will most likely be someone working or playing at the store that is willing to teach you!</p>
            <p>Sleeves are not provided with your first 30-card deck, but playing with Magic&trade; cards almost requires sleeves, so pick up a pack of 100 sleeves (I like <a href="https://www.dragonshield.com/webshop/29-matte-100">Dragon Shield Mattes</a>) while you're at it. This will be enough for any first deck you choose to make!</p>
            <br>
            <p>If having a friend teach you won't be easy and you don't have a store within a reasonable distance, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena">Magic&trade;'s Arena App</a> provides an extensive on-rails tutorial that's great at teaching the basics of color identity and strategy. This will be your first game! Skip the next step if you've decided to play the Arena tutorial.</p>
            <h2 id="step3"><em>Your First Game!</em></h2>
            <p>If you can, have your friend set up a fixed game using the decks you have, where the decisions are linear and have no branching paths. This will give you the basics such as phase order, mana, and combat. Rewind and repeat the preset game if necessary. Ask your friend to explain concepts again if you don't understand the first time! Patience is key. It may not be intuitive at first, especially if you have other card games' rules ingrained, but it will soon become like second nature.</p>
            <p>Next, you can move on to shuffling up the beginner decks and playing regular Magic&trade; with them. Try swapping decks every couple rounds or moving onto new colors once you get the hang of the ones you started with.</p>
            <p>Once you feel like you have a pretty good handle on the beginner decks, you can move on to those constructed decks I said to avoid to start teaching more difficult concepts and strategies such as the stack, planeswalkers, and priority.</p>
            <p>More than likely at this point you have a favorite color! Great! Hold onto that. You can build a successful deck out of any color or combination in pretty much every format, so let that take you into your Magic&trade; career!</p>
