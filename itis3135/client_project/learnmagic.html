                So, you're interested in getting yourself or a friend into Magic&trade;, but don't know where to start.<br>
            </h2>
            <p>You probably fall into one of a few different categories already, so look for the section that best describes you!</p>

            <h2><em>"I've tried learning before, but I didn't really understand..."</em></h2>
            <p>
                Maybe you tried to before, but it didn't exactly go so well...<br>
                A lot of us have gotten into it after the first try failed, mainly because approaching Magic&trade; can be a difficult undertaking.<br>
                There are so many different ways to play, and so many intricacies to playing at a higher level.<br>
                But at its core, Magic&trade; is very easy to pick up, understand, and figure out as you go!<br>
                The trick is to lay the foundation, and not to get into the difficult stuff right off the bat.<br>
