            <h2 id="step1"><em>Color Identity Personality Quiz</em></h2>
            <p>
                Each color in magic has a core <span style="font-weight:bold;">identity</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">playstyle</span>, with unique mechanics and strategies.<br>
                You can play as many colors as you want in a deck in any combination, or even none! For the sake of learning, however, it is recommended that you choose the one that draws your attention the best.<br>
                <ul>White
                    <li>Themes: Honor, Order, Discipline.</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Attack with an army of smaller creatures.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Can be described as "honest", White strategies often revolve around outmaneuvering your opponents with superior battle tactics rather than casting flashy or fundamentally game-altering spells.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Blue
                    <li>Themes: Intelligence, Self-Improvement, Adaptibility</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Disrupt the opponent's strategy while accruing incremental advantage over the course of the game.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Significantly slower-paced than other colors, Blue strategies often make the game go longer and encourage proper threat assessment. Unique to blue is the ability to stop an opponent's spell while it's being cast, and can advance its game plan even on your opponent's turn.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Black
                    <li>Themes: Power, Sacrifice, Selfishness.</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Use your life total, other cards in your hand, other creatures, and your graveyard as a resource to summon powerful creatures.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Black is all about resource management, as it allows you trade your many resources for each other. Many of the game's more underhanded tactics come from black, but this is all intentional design.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Red
                    <li>Themes: Passion, Volatility, Aggression.</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Deal direct damage to the opponent before they can get set up.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Red players want the game to end in as few turns as possible. Red can put your opponent under sudden, unexpected pressure and kill them before they get the chance to start dealing with you.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Green
                    <li>Themes: Instinct, Tradition, Strength.</li>
                    <li>Typical Strategy: Make mana faster than your opponents to produce harder-hitting, tougher threats than them.</li>
                    <li>Playstyle: Green often gives up its early game to set up for a mid-game where you're producing bigger, more hard-hitting creatures than your opponents that are hard to interact with and letting them speak for themselves.</li>
                </ul>
