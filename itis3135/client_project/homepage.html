            <p>My reviews of the local game stores will be partially objective, but with as much love as I have for this game and the scene, much of this will be anecdotal and subjective.</p>

            <h1 class="center">The Mighty Meeple</h1>

                The Charlotte Magic&trade; scene is full of wonderful people and down-to-earth, friendly stores. The Mighty Meeple is not one of them.
                As much as I want to speak nothing but positivity about the Magic&trade; scene here in Charlotte, I have some personal criticisms of Meeple.
                Not to say that the Meeple doesn't have its place in the local scene, I've given them plenty of business. 
                Their online presence is by far the most accessible, and with an in-store card sorting machine, you can place a large order and have it ready by the time you get there.
                Their inventory is also quite robust, and presentation very clean.
                They host a lot of events, and have plenty of space in the back to sit down and play casually.
                They also offer decent prices on trade-ins, and will buy almost any card you want to sell them.
                Most other stores are very selective about their trade-ins, not taking certain cards and not willing to take trade-ins of premium versions of cards.
                Interestingly, the back of the store is dedicated to disc golf, one of the owner's other hobbies.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Meeple is a business first through and through.
                While not outrageously priced, you will be undoubtedly be paying the highest prices for your cards at Meeple.
                I'm aware that this is somewhat of a superficial criticism of the Meeple, but the environment is not very welcoming compared to the other stores.
                Each store I'm going to list is undoubtedly a business, but the Meeple has by far the most corporate and sterile environment.
                Somewhat related, without throwing any accusations around, I do not know a single person that has had a positive experience with the owner of the store.
                A friend of mine who worked at the store for a summer told me that he got upset when she beat him in a game of Magic&trade;.
                My roommate told me that when he bought a card from them, he took it out of the plastic sleeve right at the counter and questioned the quality at which it was sold, saying it was more damaged than advertised.
                The person at the counter promptly told him that they have a strict no return policy on cards taken out of their sleeve, and he couldn't do anything about it at that point.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Meeple may be the closest, cleanest, most convenient, have the most events, and have the best inventory, but it does not have nearly the character, friendly atmosphere, and customer service that the other stores in the area have.
                If you're not looking for anything but a cold, impersonal relationship with Magic&trade;, then the Meeple is for you, but I implore you to try any other store first, and you'll see why in my last two reviews.

            <h1 class="center">Get Some Game</h1>
            <h2 class="center">1224 Commercial Ave, Charlotte, NC 28205</h2>
            <h2 class="center">~15min from campus</h2>

            <p>
                Get Some Game is a wonderful store run by the Fortner family, friendly people with a great sense of humor who see Magic&trade; as a fun game and social experience first, and a business model second.
                Their inventory is large but hit-or-miss if you're looking for newer cards, but I always try to support them when I can.
                Their prices are the lowest and closest to market price, as their online storefront is hosted by TCGPlayer, the primary online marketplace for Magic&trade; cards.
                They may not have a large Magic&trade; inventory, but they dip their toes into selling a bunch of other products for Magic&trade;-adjacent interests, such as gundams, anime products, plushes, and other card games.
                They have frequent events for other card games as well, mainly Cardfight Vanguard and Yugioh.
                Now we get to the subjective, anecdotal part of the review.

                My 21st birthday was spent at a brewery where the owners were hosting a weekly sealed league of the new set, mostly as an opportunity to play with their close friends and the community.
                The buy-in for the event was definitely much less than what the booster packs cost them, so they were definitely losing money to host the event.
                They gave out goofy little My Little Pony card sleeves for the event for free because they saw their distributor couldn't get rid of them and were selling them at a massively discounted price.
                Mostly, though, they said they just thought giving them out would be funny.
                My roommate would go there all the time and buy packs of Masters 25 to try to open a Jace, The Mind Sculptor. 
                After a few weeks of going there almost daily and buying a few packs each time, to no avail, they surprised him with an unopened From The Vault: Twenty that contained a Jace.
                At the time it was going for around $100, and he would have definitely have continued to give them money until he opened a Jace, but t

                They've expressed an interest in working with us at the club, though admittedly none of us have followed up with them to set anything up.
                If you're ever in Charlotte, go ahead and check them out!

                I'll go ahead and state my bias towards PBKW by admitting that I worked there with the owning Milburn family, husband and wife Matt and Danielle, for nearly 2 years.
                Though I stopped working there nearly 2 years ago and haven't played there much since, not much has changed as far as I can tell.
                Their inventory is also hit-or-miss, like Get Some Game, but PBKW differs from the other two stores in that they don't have an online storefront at all.
                Whereas Get Some has an assortment of random cards, PBKW's inventory is mostly focused on keeping competitively-relevant cards in stock, eschewing all others.
                You can email them a list of cards to pull or call, but you're probably best off going in-person.
                PBKW is the store to go to if you're looking to treat Magic&trade; as a competitive game, with a thriving Modern scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                Matt has made it clear that the store is run more out of love for tabletop gaming than for profit, so he has explicitly stated a complete disinterest in putting his focus into an online storefront.
                In his words, he'd rather focus on the locals and regulars that come into the store, as he's able to actually talk to them. 
                PBKW opened in 2008, and had been in the red all those years until 2020, with his wife Danielle supporting the business through her psychology practice.
                Walking into PBKW, you'll likely be greeted by Danielle or Matt (and their weiner dog) almost immediately.
                Matt is very passionate about everything in the store, from comics to tabletop games to Magic&trade;, and he'll answer any question you have with enthusiasm.
                Once again, my bias is hard to discard, but PBKW felt like a family for the entire time I worked there. 
                I met my favorite people there, and am currently living with my best friend that I met there.
                I owe breaking out of my shell to PBKW, and loved to see the same friendly faces every weekend my last couple years of high school.
                You might be hesitant to give PBKW a chance, as it's a while away from campus and lacks a significant online presence, but it's more than worth it to give it a shot if you're a competitive player or just have a love for tabletop games.
