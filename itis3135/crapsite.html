	                <ul>
		                <li>The header bleeds into the main content of the page, with no clear separation using horizontal lines or colors/images.</li>
		                <li>The collection of images that make up the sidebar do not particularly contrast with the green or blue of the main contents of the page, and certainly do not make it easier to see the links in the sidebar.</li>
	                </ul>
	                <li>Repetition</li>
	                <ul>
		                <li>Granted, the color contrast between blue, green, and yellow is good design, but there is almost no rhyme or reason as to why they appear in different parts of the page. The header text is yellow, and so is the background for the informational images</li>
		                <li>Red is also used for a lot of the text, which is grating on the eyes.</li>
		                <li>The placement of clickable links and information is scattered, with no pattern to guide the eyes towards any sort of intentional organization.</li>
		                <li>The events listed at the bottom page use different font sizes to separate the difficulty level of the classes at some points, and asterisks to do the same thing at other points.</li>
		                <li>The font is not consistent between the main, header, and footer, and text within the informational images in main.</li>
		                <li>No use of horizontal lines, or anything that would clearly divide pieces of information</li>
		                <li>The formatting of the same information in the header and footer are different</li>
	                </ul>
	                <li>Alignment</li>
	                <ul>
		                <li>The text within the main element is all centered, leaving the webpage to look like a "christmas tree".</li>
		                <li>All elements float left, which makes it odd to look at when zooming out or in, as the right side of the page is vacant compared to the left</li>
	                </ul>
	                <li>Proximity</li>
	                <ul>
		                <li>Granted, the prices, dates, and times of events are always close together, but there is no consistent theme to how it is displayed.</li>
		                <li>There are multiple sections with clickable links, some being large buttons and some being text that is a link at the top or bottom of the page</li>
	                </ul>
                </ul>
